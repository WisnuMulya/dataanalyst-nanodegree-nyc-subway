    "## Section 1: Statistical Test\n",
    "Statistical test that is choosen to analyze this dataset is **Mann-Whitney U Test** because as will be seen below, the distribution of the sample is not following a Gaussian or Normal distribution. Therefore, it is appropriate to use Mann-Whitney U test, because unlike Welch's T test, it does not assume that the data come from any probability distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, a testing could be conducted to make strong of the decision of using Mann-Whitney U test by performing **Shapiro-Wilk Test**, which will test whether the distribution of the sample is normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, since Mann-Whitney U test only tests whether the two samples come from the same population and not necessarily tells the direction of the test, the test will be a **two-tail test**.\n",

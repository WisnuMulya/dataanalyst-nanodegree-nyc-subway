    <h1>Analyzing the NYC Subway Dataset by Wisnu Mulya</h1>
    <h2>Section 1: Statistical Test</h2>
    <h3>1.1 Which statistical test did you use to analyze the NYC subway data? Did you use a one-tail or a two-tail P value? What is the null hypothesis? What is your p-critical value?</h3>
    <p>H null: There is no difference between mean of NYC subway entries when it is raining and when it is not raining.<br>H alternative: Mean of entries of NYC subway is difference between when it is raining and when it is not raining.<br>Method: Mann-Whitney U-Test with two-tail P value<br></p>
    <h3>1.2 Why is this statistical test applicable to the dataset? In particular, consider the assumptions that the test is making about the distribution of ridership in the two samples.</h3>
    <p>The Mann-Whitney U Test is applicable because it does not assume any type of distribution and Welch's T Test is not applicable because the distribution plotted in problem set 3.1 in Intro to Data Science course does not support that the distribution is normal.</p>
    <h3>1.3 What results did you get from this statistical test? These should include the following numerical values: p-values, as well as the means for each of the two samples under test.</h3>
    <p>Mean of entries with rain: 1105.446<br>Mean of entries without rain: 1090.279<br>U value: 1924409167<br>P value: 0.025</p>
    <h3>1.4 What is the significance and interpretation of these results?</h3>
    <p>The result is significance at 95% confidence and thus null hypothesis is rejected.</p>
    <h2>Section 2: Linear Regression</h2>
    <h3>2.1 What approach did you use to compute the coefficients theta and produce prediction for ENTRIESn_hourly in your regression model:
    <ul>
      <li>Gradient descent (as implemented in exercise 3.5)</li>
      <li>OLS using Statsmodels</li>
      <li>Or something different?</li>
    </ul></h3>
    <p>The approach used is gradient descent as implemented in problem set 3.5 in Intro to Data Science course.</p>
    <h3>2.2 What features (input variables) did you use in your model? Did you use any dummy variables as part of your features?</h3>
    <p>I used these variables as my input variables: rain, precipitation, hour, mean temperature, and fog. My variable used in the regression is unit.</p>
    <h3>2.3 Why did you select these features in your model? We are looking for specific reasons that lead you to believe that
the selected features will contribute to the predictive power of your model.</h3>
    <p>Besides that the variables I selected are already default input variables in probelm set 3.5 Intro to Data Science course, I agree with the selection since the Mann-Whitney U Test suggests that there are significance in entries mean when it is raining and the others are my intuition on what might make people discouraged or encouraged in using subway.</p>
    <h3>2.4 What are the coefficients (or weights) of the non-dummy features in your linear regression model?</h3>
    <p>Truthfully I have no idea how to obtain it from the coding I've done. I actually need help on this.</p>
    <h3>2.5 What is your modelâ€™s R2 (coefficients of determination) value?</h3>
    <p>0.465</p>
    <h3>2.6 What does this R2 value mean for the goodness of fit for your regression model? Do you think this linear model to predict ridership is appropriate for this dataset, given this R2  value?</h3>
    <p>I think this size of R2 is considered good enough as according to Cohen an R value of 0.18 is considered as a small effect and mine is even larger if it is not squared. I got it from Intro to Inferential Statistics.</p>
    <h2>Section 3: Visualization</h2>
    <h3>Please include two visualizations that show the relationships between two or more variables in the NYC subway data.</h3>
    <h3>3.1 One visualization should contain two histograms: one of  ENTRIESn_hourly for rainy days and one of ENTRIESn_hourly for non-rainy days.</h3>
    <img src="histo_entry_rain.png">
    <p>The histogram shows that the data not distributed normally and intuitively shows large difference in entries between when it rains and not.</p>
    <h3>3.2 One visualization can be more freeform. You should feel free to implement something that we discussed in class (e.g., scatter plots, line plots) or attempt to implement something more advanced if you'd like</h3>
    <img src="ridership_to_hour.png">
    <p>The histogram shows that the data are distributed normally and there seems to be a pattern on when the busy hour is.</p>
    <h2>Section 4: Conclusion</h2>
    <h3>4.1 From your analysis and interpretation of the data, do more people ride the NYC subway when it is raining or when it is not raining?</h3>
    <p>From the analysis conducted on the data using Mann-Whitney U Test, there is a significance difference between entries when it is raining and when it is not. The result suggests that null hypothesis is false. However, this data is significance at alpha level of 95% and not 99%. This might suggest that the correlation exists but it is not strong.</p>
    <h3>4.2 What analyses lead you to this conclusion? You should use results from both your statistical tests and your linear regression to support your analysis.</h3>
    <p>U value of the Mann-Whitney U-Test conducted is 1924409167 and it suggests that there is difference in entry when it is raining and when it is not. Moreover, the result of the probability that there is no difference and the data is as is, is 2.5% and this suggests that there is a correlation even though that it is not a strong one since it does not qualify a 99% alpha test. The R^2 suggests that the relation is strong too.</p>
    <h2>Section 5: Reflection</h2>
    <h3>5.1 Please discuss potential shortcomings of the methods of your analysis, including:<ol><li>Dataset</li><li>Analysis, such as the linear regression model or statistical test</li></h3>
    <p>On the dataset, I think it could be improved by data from a whole year dataset instead of the current dataset that only provides dataset from the month of May since it might produce a more rich variables to be analysed on like how the entries relate to holidays and so on.<br>On the anaysis, I expect errors to be around since it is my first formal experience on analyzing big data like this using programming methods and I do it hastily since my learning is not that optimal that I understand the whole thing and flawlessly. Moreover, I also have not yet explored other methods besides Mann-Whittney U Test and Descent Regression that I used in this analysis and thus I expect that that must be other methods that would produce a more accurate result.</p>
